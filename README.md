# ML-aadhaar-authentication
A lightweight, real-time Aadhaar card image Validation system using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and OpenCV. Built with Python and Tkinter, this tool classifies Aadhaar images as valid or invalid using machine learning and image preprocessing techniques.
A real-time Aadhaar validation system built entirely in a **single Jupyter Notebook**. This project uses image processing and machine learning (SVM) to classify Aadhaar card images as **valid** or **invalid**, with a fully integrated GUI for prediction.
